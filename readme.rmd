Probability is the glue between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Probability is the study of how data can be generated from a model.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

rbinom(1,1,.5)
#number of random draws, number of random coins we're flipping, prob of heads

#flip 1 fair coin 1 million times
flips<-rbinom(1000000,1,.5)
table(flips)
hist(flips)
# OBSERVATION: The higher the number of flips the more likely we tend to 0.5

#flip 1 biased coin 1 million times
flipsbias<-rbinom(1000000,1,.8)
table(flipsbias)
# OBSERVATION: The higher the number of flips the more likely we tend to p

#flip 1 million fair coins once
flipmil <- rbinom(1,1000000,0.5)
flipmil
# OBSERVATION: The higher the number of flips the more likely we tend to p

#flip 1 million fair coin 1 million times
flipmilmil <- rbinom(1000000,1000000,0.5)
mean(flipmilmil)
min(flipmilmil)
max(flipmilmil)
plot(flipmilmil)
# OBSERVATION: The higher the number of flips the more likely we tend to p

# Generate 100 occurrences of flipping 10 coins, each with 30% probability
test <- rbinom(100,10,0.3)
hist(test)
```
